It was started as learning new tech staff. It is collection of solutions that can be easily composed to build concrete system.
Please find [code on github](https://github.com/sergeyt/pandora).

Basically it is incomplete BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) without UI and crafted during random hackathons and challenges I was involved occasionally.

## Use Cases

Pandora has been already used in the following hackatons/challenges:

- Messenger Android App on [CompTechNSK 2019](/reflection/comptechnsk/2019)
- [Merlin](/merlin) - challenge I was doing in one week requested as part of hiring process
- [LingvoGraph](/lingvograph) - long-term challenge to build large-scale Social Knowledge Graph for Linguistics
## Status

- Work in progress

## Tools

It is used pretty modern tech:

- DGraph
- Golang
- Python
- and many more
