## What is it?

It is a complex machine with a lot of software and hardware components that can write holograms and different diffractive optical elements.
During part of my education at [NSU](https://www.nsu.ru/) I was working to modernize software components of this system at [IA&E SB RAS](https://www.iae.nsk.su/en/) at laboratory of Difractive Optics.
Moreover I have an amazing opportunity to work these genius people:
* Dimitri Denk (http://www.denktech.de/)
* Ruslan Shimansky (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruslan_Shimansky)
* Viktor P. Korolkov
* and other scientists
