Hello friend or stranger :smile:

> __TL;DR__ 18 years of experience in server and client-side development. Areas of expertise: Architecture, Web and API development, .NET, C#, SQL, Web API, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, Git, Agile. I don't afraid to learn and try new things and make crazy stuff like [a cross compiler](https://github.com/grapecity/pagefx)

I am SergeyT. I am a professional software engineer and usually I play full stack roles.

I've been writing computer programs with passion for half of my life.
I solved a ton of puzzles and fixed no end of bugs.
And I am still engineer writing code almost every day.

I am kind of a "small fish" like those engineers who are ready to work hard with dedication to get things done.
This makes me having mindset to solve problems pragmatically and proactively.

I love working on complex projects with positive and smart people around me.

I've been being involved in challenging projects ranging from
* [hardware abstraction layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCEM6Z3KvU0&list=PLQR99hR6kJODS8Nehz1PkfvNYTlFJR9fj&index=2)
* [cross-compilers](https://github.com/GrapeCity/pagefx)
* [report generators](https://www.grapecity.com/activereports)
* [distributed systems](https://www.spirent.com/products/lab-as-a-service-automation-velocity)

When working on a particular project I care about finding efficient and simple solutions.
I care about making friendly interfaces that are [easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly](https://www.aristeia.com/Papers/IEEE_Software_JulAug_2004_revised.htm).

Iâ€™m currently happily employed by GrapeCity Inc and just keep doing digital things and doing it with calm and passion. Usually having fun :)

Thanks for reading :)
