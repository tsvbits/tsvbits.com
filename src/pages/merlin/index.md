spoiler: Open source document search and processing solutions
---

Originally it is supposed to be a open-source competitive solution for [Ambar](https://ambar.cloud/).
But it is going with crazy ideas like NPL search.

## Features

- Live demo built with React
- More less code than in [Ambar](https://ambar.cloud/)

## Status

- Incomplete, but many parts are in pretty good shape
- Implemented using [Pandora](https://github.com/sergeyt/pandora) in one week

## Tools

It is used pretty modern tech:

- DGraph
- Apache Tika
- Golang
- Kotlin
- and many more
