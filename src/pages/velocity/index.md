It is called [Velocity](https://www.spirent.com/products/velocity) and owned by [Spirent](https://www.spirent.com).

While being employed by [Xored](http://www.xored.com/) I was part of talented team who doing major part of this system.

I had tech lead and team lead duties, but 50% of time helping team with real code. As the team lead, I led a team of 10-15 full-stack engineers doing code review and consulting on daily basis. As the tech lead, I had involved in finding efficient solutions especially to tackle customer-faced scalability issues. I had made initiatives make more scalable development of huge frontend. I had direct communication with customers investigating and fixing incidents on production systems. I was the first point of contact with the product owner and management groups helping solving business problems using the full spectrum of technologies available and knowledge of the product capabilities. And eventually we have made one of the best LaaS (Laboratory as a Service) solutions.
