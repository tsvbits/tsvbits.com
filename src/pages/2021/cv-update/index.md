> TL;DR you can CV page at [here](/cv)

I've updated the CV micro-app I mentioned sometime ago in [this post](/cv-micro-app).
The major addition is support of [CodersRank](https://codersrank.io/) profile as data source.

Now you can specify src query parameter to take data from CodersRank. After that the page can fetch the data and render it. For example, `src=cr-sergeyt` will render the data for sergeyt username. You can see [it in action](/cv?src=cr-sergeyt).

Enjoy!
