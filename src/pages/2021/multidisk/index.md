# Lets build mini Google Drive clone in few hours

> TL;DR you can find source code of the app at https://github.com/sergeyt/uploadcare-disk

I am going to show you how to quickly build a small Google Drive app powered by [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com) platform. Believe me or not but I've built the app within one morning.

## TODO

- upload video to youtube
- cover screenshot

## What I've done

The app can do the following:
- Adding multiple drives
- At this point I've implemented only [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com) drive, but I'd like to add support for Google Drive, Dropbox, etc

## Tools

This app is built using the following tools:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## How I've done this

Step by step.
