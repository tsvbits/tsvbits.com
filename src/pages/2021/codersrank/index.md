CodersRank is nice auto-profile for developers based on open source contribution. 
I have one generated for me. Please take a look at https://profile.codersrank.io/user/sergeyt/.

Also CodersRank is capable to generate beautiful CV. [Here](../../resume/resume.pdf) is mine in PDF format.

It is not an add of CodersRank. It is kind of ad for my profile :smile:
