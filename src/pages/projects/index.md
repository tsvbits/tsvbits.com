This page lists projects that I've been involved as software engineer.
Some of them are still being used by somebody.

## Fint
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2019 - now`</span>

It is compact [.NET CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) interpreter written in pure F#.
See [this post](/fint) to get more details about this project.

Status **experimental**, **incomplete**

## LingvoGraph
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2018 - now`</span>

Student driven project for learning second languages and approaching latest technologies. [More about it](/lingvograph).

## Spirent Velocity
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2016 - 2018`</span>

I had a great opportunity to be a developer of [Spirent Velocity automation platform](/velocity). Talented dev team. I had a fun time.

## ActiveReports
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2010 - 2015`</span>

I had a great opportunity to be a developer of [ActiveReports](https://www.grapecity.com/activereports) - one of the advanced and complete reporting platform for .NET. Talented dev team. I had a fun time.

Here I was one of major driver to dramatically boost performance of this report generator.

## PageFX
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2007 - 2008`</span>

It is binary-level compiler from [.NET CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) to [Adobe Flash Player VM](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/avm2overview.pdf) byte code used in [ActiveReports](https://www.grapecity.com/activereports).
It is recently [open sourced](/flash-viewer-story).
It was extremely interesting and one of the challenging project I've ever worked on.
It was used to build [Flash Viewer](http://help.grapecity.com/activereports/webhelp/Legacy/ActiveReports6/topic124.html) component. This component was quite popular some days.
I am proud how this compiler was stable and it worked without changes for years.

[This GitHub page](https://github.com/GrapeCity/pagefx) lists all contributors to the project I've worked with.

Status **dead**, but it can be reanimated for example to allow using C# to develop applications for [Adobe Integrated Runtime](https://get.adobe.com/air/)

## Circle Laser Writing Systems
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2002 - 2007`</span>

At [IAE](https://www.iae.nsk.su/en/) at laboratory of diffractive optics I've been developing different software components to manage [CLWS](http://denktech.com/img/pclws300.jpg) resources. One of the major component is Device Manager. It is a component to manage hardware drivers called devices.

See [this post](/clws) to get more details about this project.

Status **still-used** in the laboratory of diffractive options.

## voXcat for DiOptic
:calendar:<span class="calendar">`2002 - 2003`</span>

CAT means Computer Aided Tomography. It is tomography analysis software.
Implemented in C++ using Microsoft Foundation Classes.
It was first paid contract.
See [this post](/voxcat) to get more details about this project.
