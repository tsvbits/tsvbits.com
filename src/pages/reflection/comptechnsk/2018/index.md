It was second time I was invited to [CompTechNSK](https://vk.com/wall-136198863_60) and decided to speak about golang since at that time I was kind of small Golang fan. BTW I am still fan of Golang, but now it is a bit a small love :smile:

My presentation was quite funny enough. Slides are available at the following [internet address](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rXDFcO6SYfu2jOn8EoRJWdK2iILT3hfCTvS8A_Lbkb0/edit?usp=sharing) (warning: content is in Russian).
