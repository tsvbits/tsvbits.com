I did workshop for JavaScript at [CompTechNSK 2019](https://vk.com/wall-136198863_172). Slides are available at the following [internet address](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11WhYfllTpmj3NAKPfqm1tihxPA1TIiC9BlMiE5CWf6g/edit?usp=sharing) (warning: content is in Russian).

Also I was a mentor of a group students which was capable to build a mobile app (kind of Messenger) in one week using Flatter framework and using [Pandora](/pandora) as backend.
