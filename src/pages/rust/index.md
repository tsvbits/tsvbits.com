I am learning Rust atm and as usual I am:
- learning by doing
- trying to make useful bits using it

I might blog about it too, please don't expect too much :)

Also note there is only one efficient way to learn Rust. It is by talking with Rust compiler.
It seems it is only way to become proficient in it. Reading books is not enough.

Good luck to me in this way to be yet another Rustacean :)

## Footnote

It would be nice to have an auto generated post index by given tag with single markdown placeholder
