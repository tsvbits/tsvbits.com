Some of SOLID principles are less important for me, here is why?

- I'm used to write more functional coding atm, so OOP is less important practice for me
- Immutable, purity, composobality matters for me more than knowing how each symbol in SOLID abbreviation is decoded :smile:
- It is not magic, knowing how they are stated does not help you on practice

So I am solidless coder, sorry recruters :smile:

## Fun story

I even failed some interview saying that I don't remember SOLID principles exactly what they states :smile:

## Footnote

I do think SOLID principles are useful. But knowing them are not that important to use them on practice without noticing that you apply some principle.
