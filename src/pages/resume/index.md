Latest update: 27 November 2019<br>

I've been writing computer programs with passion for half of my life.
I wrote a lot of software and fix thousands of bugs. And I am still engineer.

I am small fish like those engineers who working hard and dedication driven.
This makes me having mindset to solve problems pragmatically and proactively.

I love working on complex projects with positive and smart people around me.

I've been being involved in challenging projects ranging from
* [hardware abstraction layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCEM6Z3KvU0&list=PLQR99hR6kJODS8Nehz1PkfvNYTlFJR9fj&index=2)
* [cross-compilers](https://github.com/GrapeCity/pagefx)
* [report engines](https://www.grapecity.com/activereports)
* [distributed systems](https://www.spirent.com/products/lab-as-a-service-automation-velocity)

When working on a particular project I care about finding efficient and simple solutions.
I care about making interfaces that are [easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly](https://www.aristeia.com/Papers/IEEE_Software_JulAug_2004_revised.htm).

I’m currently happily employed by GrapeCity Inc and just keep going.
