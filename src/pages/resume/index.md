I've been writing computer programs with passion for half of my life.
I might literally write million lines of code :)
I love to work on complex projects with positive and smart people around me improving both user and developer experiences and bring a strong technical leadership to a team.
I've been being involved in challenging projects ranging from distributed systems, report engines and even low-level compilers [like this one](https://github.com/GrapeCity/pagefx).
I am proactive and pragmatic problem solver and getting things done is important to me.

When working on a project I particularly care about just making bits better every day.
I care about finding efficient and simple solutions.
I care about making interfaces that [easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly](https://www.aristeia.com/Papers/IEEE_Software_JulAug_2004_revised.htm).

I’m currently working at GrapeCity and just keep going.
