I have been developing software with passion for 17 years being involved in challenging projects using various technologies ranging from server side applications, compilers or report engines.

I love to work on complex projects, improve both user and developer experiences and bring a strong technical leadership to a team.

When working on a project I particularly care about continuous improvement bit by bit. I care about performance, quality, extensibility, maintainability, simplicity and usability of consistent interfaces that easy to use correctly and hard to use incorectly.

I’m currently working at GrapeCity and just keep going.
