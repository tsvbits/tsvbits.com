Hello! My name is Sergey. I am a software engineer from Russia.
I have wonderful experience with more than 15 years programming different kind of computers for life. 
I am still having fun making money this way and probably more importantly for you I am still productive.
I have technology-agnostic mindset so learning and trying new things is my hobby.
Usually I play full stack roles, but it is ok to me focusing only on frontend development.
I might be the one who will write a lot of useful bits in your next gig.
Thank you for watching this video and have a nice day.
