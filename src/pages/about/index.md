Hey there! My name is Sergey Todyshev. I am software engineer.
You can [email me](mailto:stodyshev@gmail.com) to get [technical support](/support) or even hire me

I've done and I can do this

- pretty complex massive web apps like [Velocity](/velocity)
- complex distributed systems like [Velocity](/velocity) since I am fullstack developer
- report generators like [ActiveReports](/activereports)
- low level cross compilers like [PageFX](/pagefx)
- tomography analysis software like [voXcat](/voxcat) for [DiOptic](https://www.dioptic.de)
- [interferometry software](/interferometry)
- LabView like visual programming system, will create separate page later
- hardware abstraction layers like [Device Manager](/devicemanager) for [IAE](/iae)

in short both application-level and system-level programming with any kind of complexity
